intellij 
Java version 11
JavaFX runtime of version 17.0.6
MySQL connector-j-8.1.0

How to install the code: please follow the reference of how to build the an excutable Java app.

how to run the code: go to "\app\src\main\java\com\example\app\" and open HelloApplication.java using intellij, Because the configuratins are set in this spot to make it easier to run the code there.

you can run the built application which is found in  "app/out/artifacts/app_jar/app.jar"

Please be informed that the code might work only in my machine because of post.csv file are set in a specific directory, i acknowledge that its a bad practice but this assignment does not ask for a robust application that can run through multipe devices ( i can dockerize it if you want :) )




*** outside scope of assignment (my words) ***


i really enjoyed working in this assignment because i have learned a lot of things but unfortuantly i have final year project that took enormus amoung time that does not allow me to do much work.
I would like to thank you for your hard work readying my codes and other students code :D.
